	<h1>My city is called Washington D.C.</h1>
	<p>Shadow was created in a secret lab hidden beneath Washington D.C. Though the city above is bustling with politics and monuments, Shadow’s world is sterile, silent, and full of mystery. The lab is his birthplace a place of experiments, glowing screens, and strange machines. It’s special because it gave him life, but it also holds secrets about his powers and purpose. Shadow dreams of escaping the lab and discovering the world beyond.</p>
